# [CLEAN] Phobos 1.9.0 Buildable SRC & Release

This source has been checked by two people, myself and a friend. My friend did not find anything as he briefly went through the files. I have scanned and gone through every file and lib, as well as replaced them to make sure it's clean. This is **safe to use.**

**There is no default bind, you can do .bind clickgui key to bind it and it will work.**

I don't know how, or who leaked this, but a leak is a leak and it's whatever lol, btw phobos if you're reading this, I suggest just making your client open source & public like Kami blue since it's pretty much public now troll, and your rewrite will get leaked  eventually as well 🤪🤪🤪

## Running in a Dev Environment:
```gradle
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew runClient
```

## Compiling the client:
```gradle
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew build
```
You will find your built jar in the directory `builds/libs`.

## Too lazy to build the jar yourself?
